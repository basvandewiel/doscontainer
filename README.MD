# DOS Container

Doscontainer is a toolbox that aims to make it easy to mass-generate large numbers of
virtual hard-disk image files and load those up with ready to run retro games and apps.

The primary focus of this project is the MiSTer FPGA project's AO486 core, with the possible
addition of the currently budding PCXT core at a later stage.

## The problem

Simply put? There are thousands of MS-DOS and early Windows games available, but the skill
to get these all running nicely is increasingly difficult to come by.

## The solution

Use principles from modern Infra-as-Code and DevOps to encode and preserve the skills of the
past so that future entusiasts won't need to overcome a large knowledge bump first before
enjoying those beautiful experiences for themselves.

## The nitty-gritty

The process looks simple enough from afar:

  - Generate virtual hard drive image for a particular retro game/app.
  - Install the required OS for it into the image.
  - Inject the actual game/app into the image.
  - Add drivers and other prerequisites into the mix.
  - Glue it together with a friendly bootup script.
  - Fun!

But the devil is in a million details along the way. This is a hobby project, so the time
investment is low and I'm learning a number of completely new skills myself so any help
is very much appreciated.

## Current progress

The current progress is about 30% of the way towards step 1: the automated generation of
virtual hard drive images. That's also one of the most complicated steps as it's hard to do
this using modern tools. The doscontainer binary that you can build from this repo will perform
this function and probably not much else. It's built in Rust, a systems language that feels
more at home for me than anything else that allows me to write individual bits to a specific
spot inside a file.

The binary itself is not supposed to run on a constrained platform like the systems we are
emulating, so it's no problem that the compiled release build already clocks in at over 800KB.
The main emphasis for it is to be correct and somewhat maintainable.

## Next steps

I'm envisioning the other steps as much simpler in a technical sense, leaning more heavily on
modern CI/CD tools that should be able to mount the partition from a disk image and dump all
sorts of templated files in there. Tools like Ansible could be a good fit for this, but I'm
not at that point of the design yet.
