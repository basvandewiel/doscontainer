# How to contribute to Doscontainer

This project is a hobby project for myself and anyone who'd like it. The license, therefore,
is 2-clause BSD and that's the only license I'll accept for contributions. See LICENSE.MD
for details on that.

## How to contribute?

I'll be filling the issue tracker with whatever needs to be done. Anything that's not in
progress is completely fair game for pull requests. Anyting that *is* in progress should
be coordinated. Add a comment to the issue please before running off with it.

## What's in it for you?

Nothing but eternal glory as a contributer to this project. I'm doing this as a hobby so
hopefully you'll enjoy it too.

## Can you fork and run off with my code?

Sure, go ahead! If you make a trillion dollars from doing so, more power to you.
